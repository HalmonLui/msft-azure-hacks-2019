      It is Finance Boi's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
      information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
      Policy applies to
      <a href="http://www.financeboi.com">www.financeboi.com</a> (hereinafter,
      "us", "we", or "www.financeboi.com"). We respect your privacy and are
      committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may
      provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
      ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our
      Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may

    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>
      Like most website operators, Finance Boi collects
      non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
      servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
      preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
      Finance Boi's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
      is to better understand how Finance Boi's visitors use its website. From
      time to time, Finance Boi may release non-personally-identifying
      information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
      the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finance Boi also collects potentially personally-identifying information
      like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users
      leaving comments on http://www.financeboi.com blog posts. Finance Boi only
      discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
      circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
      information as described below.
    </p>

    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
      Certain visitors to Finance Boi's websites choose to interact with Finance
      Boi in ways that require Finance Boi to gather personally-identifying
      information. The amount and type of information that Finance Boi gathers
      depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
      sign up for a blog at http://www.financeboi.com to provide a username and
      email address.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember
      that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
      storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
      means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.

      and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena,

      expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request
      (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
      we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond
      to your request or to help us support other users. Finance Boi takes all
